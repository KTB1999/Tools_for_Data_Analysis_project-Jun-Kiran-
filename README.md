"Exploring the Impact of EU Policies passed from 1990 to 2021 on Renewable Energy Adoption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction in the Netherlands"
We aim  to analyze the effectiveness of EU policies in promoting renewable energy adoption and reducing greenhouse gas emissions specifically in the Netherlands. The goal is to assess the correlation between EU policy initiatives, renewable energy capacity, and carbon emissions in the Netherlands to understand the country's progress toward the EU's environmental goals.

1990s:
Directive 91/271/EEC (1991) - Concerning urban waste-water treatment.
Directive 91/676/EEC (1991) - On the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources.
Directive 96/61/EC (1996) - Concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC).
Kyoto Protocol (1997) - An international treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2000s:
Directive 2001/80/EC (2001) - On the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants.
Directive 2001/81/EC (2001) - On national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants.
Directive 2001/77/EC (2001) - On the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market.
Directive 2003/87/EC (2003) - Establishing the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
Directive 2004/8/EC (2004) - On the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market.
Renewable Energy Directive (2009/28/EC) (2009) - Establishing binding renewable energy targets for EU member states.

2010s:
Effort Sharing Decision (2013/162/EU) (2013) - On determining the annual emission allocations of member states for the period from 2013 to 2020.
Energy Efficiency Directive (2012/27/EU) (2012) - Establishing measures to improve energy efficiency.
Paris Agreement (2015) - A global accord aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Clean Energy for All Europeans Package (2016) - A comprehensive package of legislative proposals to promote clean energy and energy efficiency.
European Green Deal (2019) - A roadmap for making the EU's economy sustainable, with a strong focus on climate and energy policies.

2020s:
European Climate Law (2021) - Agreement to make the EU's climate neutrality by 2050 a legally binding target, with an intermediate target of at least 55% net greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

Game plan: 
Compare the trends in renewable energy adoption and greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands with the timeline of EU policies passed from 1990 to 2021. The objective is to identify any notable shifts or changes in renewable energy capacity and emissions reduction that coincide with the introduction of specific EU policies. 
Analyzing the relationship between EU policy initiatives (independent variable) and renewable energy adoption and greenhouse gas emissions in the Netherlands (dependent variables). The goal is to determine whether there is a significant correlation between the introduction of specific EU policies and changes in renewable energy capacity and emissions reduction in the Netherlands.
Calculate correlation coefficients to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between EU policies and renewable energy adoption and emissions reduction whilst taking into account population and gdp growth (control variables).
Conduct hypothesis test to determine if the correlations are statistically significant.
